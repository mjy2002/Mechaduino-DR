# Mechaduino-DR
Conversion of the original Open Source Hardware Mechaduino01 step motor controller Eagle BOM, pcb, and schematic design by Joe Church of Tropical Labs to KiCAD EDA. Original Mechaduino pcb and other design files can be found on OSH Park and Github https://github.com/jcchurch13/Mechaduino-Hardware

PCB upsized to NEMA 23 and Wantimotor mount pattern. Relaxed certain component spacing and removal of signal traces behind Allegro magnetic encoder chip. Converted Eagle BOM to .csv file format and included Digikey part numbers for BOM uploading to Digikey. Added “DR” suffix to “Mechaduino” and placed the Darkhorse Research horse head logo on PCB to identify DR versions of the Mechaduino stepper motor control platform originally created and designed by Joe Church Tropical Labs.
